    "Name": "Pong in Processing",
    "Description": "I recreated Pong in the java framework \"Processing\", as a school project.\nThe game is made with a focus on applying OOP principles and basic programming skills. While using the power of processing to create simple user interfaces, and add visual feedback to our code at an early learning stage.\nI created the menus from scratch, because i didn't know of a prebuilt option in processing, and as a way to challenge my creativity and coding skills.\nThe gameplay follows the same pattern as the original game, but has a twist, in the way of a timer that appears if the players keep the ball going for 20 seconds, and then a second ball spawns. With up to 5 balls active at a time.",
